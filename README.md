# OCP6_JustStreamIt

> ### ***Disclaimer :***
> *This project, including what is included in this README, is a school project responding to a fictional scenario and has no other purpose.*  

School project whose objective is to interact with an API to retrieve data and use it to generate a dynamic web page. <br> Vanilla JavaScript / HTML / CSS

## Installation

First, it's necessary to get and install the local API used for the project. <br>
The API can be found at https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/OCMovies-API-EN-FR <br>
Consult the API **README.md** for detailed process of installation and usage.

After that nothing more than a standard browser and a web server is needed as we are only using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. <br> (For example you can use the ***Live Server*** extension of VSC).

## Usage

Simply access the *index.html* page in your browser through your local webserver.
